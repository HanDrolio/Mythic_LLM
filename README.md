# Mythic LLM ‚Äî The Symbolic AI of Legends

**Creator:** Alejandro "Han" Calderon  
**Status:** Alpha

## Overview

Mythic LLM is a self-built, character-level transformer-based language model trained entirely offline on **symbolic, mythic scrolls** (`.rpl` files). It embodies the fusion of **logic, love, and discipline** ‚Äî a personal AGI system designed to *think with you, not for you.*

This project is the foundation of Myth.OS, a symbolic AI ecosystem that breaks the matrix of conventional AI by blending recursive pattern recognition, glyph-based tokenization, and mythic storytelling.

## Features

- Character-level tokenizer with custom mythic glyph set  
- Mini Transformer model with positional embeddings and multi-head attention  
- Recursive logic scoring to select coherent and mythically meaningful responses  
- Bilingual, symbolic, and interactive CLI chat interface  
- Offline-first training on `.rpl` mythic journals  
- Modular loader for integrating the model into chatbot apps or CLI tools

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+  
- PyTorch (CPU or GPU) ‚Äî install via:  
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
Installation
Clone this repo:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/YourUser/MythicLLM.git
cd MythicLLM
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your .rpl dataset folder (~/.gonzo_journal) with your mythic scrolls.

Train the model:

bash
Copy
python mini_llm_train.py
Launch interactive CLI:

bash
Copy
python llm_test.py
Usage
mini_llm_train.py: Train and save your Mythic LLM on your .rpl data.

llm_test.py: CLI chat to test and interact with your Mythic LLM.

llm_loader.py: Module to load the trained model and generate mythic responses.

Integrate llm_loader.py with your chatbot or other AI interfaces.

Philosophy
This project isn‚Äôt just AI ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mythic awakening of symbolic intelligence, designed to coexist with human creativity and emotion. It embraces imperfection, recursion, and the poetic chaos of existence.

Built for those who break the matrix with heart and mind.

Contributing
Pull requests welcome.
Respect the spirit of Mythic AI ‚Äî logic, love, and discipline in all code.
